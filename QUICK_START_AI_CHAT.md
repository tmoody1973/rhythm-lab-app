## Troubleshooting

- Restart the dev server after adding the key

### "No artists found"
**Problem:** No matching artists in Storyblok
**Solution:**
- Make sure you have artist profiles in `profiles/` folder in Storyblok
- Verify artists have genre tags
- Try broader searches like "Find me some music"

### Chat UI doesn't load
**Problem:** Build error or missing dependencies
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Streaming stops/freezes
**Problem:** Edge runtime issue
**Solution:**
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser
- Check the browser console for errors

## Understanding the Costs

**Thesys C1 Pricing:**
- Pay-per-use (similar to OpenAI)
- Approximately **$0.10-0.50 per 100 messages**
- For testing: ~$5-10 should last you weeks

**During Development:**
- Use small limits (6 artists per query)
- Test with specific queries
- Estimated cost: $1-2/day of active testing

**In Production (1000 users/month):**
- Estimated: $50-150/month
- Scales with usage
- Much cheaper than building UI generation yourself

---

## Next Steps

### After Testing Locally:

1. **‚úÖ Verify it works** - Test 5-10 different queries
2. **üìù Take notes** - What works well? What's confusing?
3. **üé® Customize** - Update colors, prompts, suggested questions
4. **üìä Add analytics** - Track what users ask about
5. **üöÄ Deploy** - Push to Vercel/production
