# Music Discovery AI - Feature #1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Just Built

You now have a fully functional AI-powered music discovery chat that:

- âœ… Uses Thesys C1 to generate interactive UI responses
- âœ… Searches your Storyblok artist catalog
- âœ… Supports genre, mood, and name-based artist discovery
- âœ… Provides intelligent recommendations
- âœ… Has a beautiful, responsive chat interface
- âœ… Streams responses in real-time

## How to Test It

### Step 1: Get Your Thesys API Key

1. Go to [thesys.dev](https://thesys.dev)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   THESYS_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Visit the AI Chat

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/ai-chat`

### Step 4: Try These Prompts

- "Find me some chill electronic music"
- "Show me jazz artists similar to Kamasi Washington"
- "What's good for studying?"
- "Discover experimental ambient artists"
- "Search for artists named floating"

## How It Works

### The Flow:

```
User asks: "Find me chill jazz"
    â†“
Your chat UI sends message to /api/ai/chat
    â†“
API calls Thesys C1 with user message + available tools
    â†“
C1 decides: "I need searchArtistsByGenre(['jazz'], 'chill')"
    â†“
Your backend executes the tool â†’ queries Storyblok
    â†“
Returns: [Artist 1, Artist 2, Artist 3, ...]
    â†“
C1 receives data and generates interactive UI
    â†“
UI streams back to your frontend
    â†“
User sees beautiful artist cards!
```

### Files Created:

**Backend:**
- `lib/thesys/config.ts` - Thesys C1 client configuration
- `lib/ai/tools.ts` - AI tool definitions (functions C1 can call)
- `lib/storyblok/ai-queries.ts` - Storyblok query functions for AI
- `app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API endpoint

**Frontend:**
- `components/ai-chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Main chat component
- `components/ai-chat/ChatMessage.tsx` - Message rendering
- `components/ai-chat/ChatInput.tsx` - User input field
- `app/ai-chat/page.tsx` - Chat page

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Music Discovery Tools

1. **searchArtistsByGenre** - Find artists by genre and mood
2. **getArtistProfile** - Get detailed artist information
3. **getSimilarArtists** - Find similar artists
4. **searchArtistsByName** - Search by artist name

### âœ… User Experience

## What's Next

You can now:

1. **Test with real users** - Get feedback on the UX
2. **Add more tools** - User favorites, playlists, etc.
3. **Move to Feature #2** - Artist Deep Dive Explorer
4. **Customize the UI** - Match your brand better
5. **Add analytics** - Track what users ask about

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to get response"
- Check that `THESYS_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Verify the API key is valid
- Check browser console for errors

### "No artists found"
- Make sure your Storyblok has artist profiles in the `profiles/` folder
- Verify artists have genre tags
- Check Storyblok API is accessible

### Streaming doesn't work
- Ensure you're using Edge runtime (`export const runtime = 'edge'`)
- Check that your Node.js version supports streaming
- Verify no middleware is blocking streaming

## Cost Estimate

Based on typical usage:
- **Thesys C1**: ~$0.10-0.50 per 100 messages
- **Storyblok**: Already included in your plan
- **Total for 1000 users/month**: $50-100
