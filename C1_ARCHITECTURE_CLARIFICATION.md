   - Just enable it in your C1 config

3. **Image Search** (Built-in!)
   - Find images related to artists
   - No separate image API needed

4. **Generative UI** (The main feature)
   - Converts responses to interactive components

## 🔄 Corrected Data Flow

### What You Actually Built:

```
User: "Find chill jazz artists"
    ↓
Your API sends to C1 with:
  - User message
  - Your custom tools (searchArtists, etc.)
    ↓
C1 Decides What To Do:
  ├─→ Call YOUR tool: searchArtists() → Gets Storyblok data
  ├─→ Use ITS web search → Gets recent artist news
  ├─→ Use ITS image search → Gets artist photos (if needed)
  └─→ Combine all data
    ↓
C1 Generates Interactive UI
    ↓
Streams back to your frontend
```

### Key Insight:

**C1 = LLM + Web Search + Image Search + UI Generation** all in one API!

## 🎨 How C1 Uses Web Search

### Example Scenario:

```typescript
// User asks: "Tell me about Floating Points recent work"

// C1 automatically:
1. Calls your tool: getArtistProfile('floating-points')
   → Returns Storyblok bio, discography

2. Uses its web search: "Floating Points 2024 2025"
   → Gets recent news, releases, tour dates

3. Combines both sources and generates UI:
   → Artist card with Storyblok data
   → "Recent News" section from web search
   → All in beautiful interactive UI
```

**You don't have to code the web search part!** C1 does it automatically when it needs current information.

---

## 🔧 Updated Tool Strategy

### Your Tools Provide:
- **Internal data** from Storyblok (artist profiles, discography)
- **User data** from Supabase (favorites, history)
- **Structured content** from your database

### C1 Automatically Adds:
- **Recent information** via web search
- **Context** about artists/events
- **Images** if needed
- **Current events** and news

### Combined Result:
Rich, comprehensive responses mixing your data with live web data!

## 🔍 Example: How C1 Combines Data

### User: "What's Kamasi Washington doing lately?"

**C1 Process:**
```
1. Calls your tool: getArtistProfile('kamasi-washington')
   Result: Bio, discography, genres from Storyblok

2. C1's web search: "Kamasi Washington 2025"
   Result: Recent releases, tour dates, news

3. C1 generates UI combining both:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🎷 Kamasi Washington                │
   │                                     │
   │ [Your Storyblok Bio Here]          │
   │                                     │
   │ Recent News (from web search):     │
   │ • New album announced for May 2025 │
   │ • European tour dates released     │
   │ • Collaboration with Thundercat    │
   │                                     │
   │ [Discography from Storyblok]       │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**You didn't have to code the web search!** C1 did it automatically.

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**What seemed complex is actually simple:**

- **Before:** "I need Thesys + Perplexity + OpenAI + image search APIs"
- **Reality:** "I just need Thesys C1 API key"

**Your architecture:**
```
Thesys C1 (all-in-one)
    ↓
Your Tools (Storyblok + Supabase)
    ↓
Beautiful Interactive UI
```

That's it! Much simpler and cheaper than initially thought.

---

**Next Step:** Just get your Thesys API key and start testing!

The code we built is already set up to take advantage of all C1's capabilities.
