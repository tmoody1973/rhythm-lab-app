## üö® Critical Notes

### Authentication Conflicts
- **Current Problem:** Mixed Supabase + Clerk auth causing infinite redirects
- **Root Cause:** Middleware trying to handle both auth systems
- **Impact:** Admin login completely broken

### User Impact
- **Existing Admin Passwords:** WILL NOT WORK after migration
- **Email Addresses:** Will remain the same
- **Required Action:** Admins need to set new passwords in Clerk

### Security Considerations
- All admin accounts have email verification confirmed
- `tarikjmoody@gmail.com` shows recent activity (logged in today)
- `admin@rhythmlabradio.com` is the primary production account
